# Terminal Chat Project (TypeScript)

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to gain an in-depth understanding of the JavaScript (and TypeScript) event loop by implementing a real-time terminal chat application using **Socket.IO** and **WebSockets**. The project explores asynchronous event handling and demonstrates how Socket.IO abstracts WebSocket communication while utilizing TypeScript to enforce type safety.

## Overview
This is a simple terminal-based chat application where multiple clients can send and receive messages in real-time through WebSockets. The project focuses on how JavaScriptâ€™s event loop works in an asynchronous environment, particularly through WebSocket communications, and how **Socket.IO** manages these connections.

Key concepts covered:
- Event loop and asynchronous operations in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Non-blocking I/O with WebSockets
- Real-time communication using Socket.IO
- Type safety and structuring a Node.js project using TypeScript

## Features
- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- Client connection and disconnection notifications
- Broadcast and private messaging
- Type safety with TypeScript for both server and client

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript
- **Socket.IO**: WebSocket library for real-time communication
- **Readline**: To handle terminal input/output in Node.js

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript (globally installed)
